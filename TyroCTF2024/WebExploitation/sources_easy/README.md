### Problem Statement
- A tip was given to nyancat that sources of this website contains the passcode to the secret door(the flag) devided into 3 parts. Then again the robot is blocking everyone to access the whole secret by not revealing the 3rd part of the secret. See if you can find the whole secret.

### Connection Details

### Solution
- 2/3 flags are in js, and csss files.
- For last part of the flag go to robots.txt to see disallowed entry of flag.php. However directly going to flag.php won't work.
- On the home page, the click Me Too button uses "./php/load_file.php?file=anothersecretmsg.html" so use the same as "./php/load_file.php?file=flag.php" to get the third part of the flag.
