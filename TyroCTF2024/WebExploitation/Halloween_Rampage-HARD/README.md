# Halloween Rampage
> Author: @Opt1mal

## Problem Statement
- Someone is secretly sending out a flag in the darkest haunted place which nyancat really needs to find their family member. See if you can get it for them.

## Connection Details
https://iitbtrustlab-halloween-rampage.chals.io

## Solution
- The application let's you pass the URL to which you want to go to, with some security measures like ipv4 regex check and blacklisted ip checks.
- The /api/flag endpoint only accepts requests from localhost.
- use http://127.0.0.01/api/flag to bypass all the restrictions to get the flag.

## FLAG: tyroCTF{Bl4ckl1st1ng_1s_n0t_enough}
